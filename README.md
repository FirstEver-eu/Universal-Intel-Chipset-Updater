- Detects both Consumer and Server platforms

### 🛡 **Multi-Layer Security**
- **SHA-256 Hash Verification** for all downloads
- **Digital Signature Validation** (Intel Corporation certificates)
- **Automated System Restore Points** before installation
- **Dual-Source Download** with backup fallback
- **Administrator Privilege Enforcement**

### ⚡ **Seamless Operation**
- No installation required - fully portable
- Automatic version checking and updates
- Clean, intuitive user interface
- Detailed logging and debug mode
- Save to Downloads folder option

### 🔄 **Comprehensive Coverage**
- Mainstream Desktop/Mobile platforms
- Workstation/Enthusiast systems
- Xeon/Server platforms
- Atom/Low-Power devices

## 📋 System Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **OS** | Windows 10/11 (x64) |
| **PowerShell** | Version 5.0 or newer |
| **Privileges** | Administrator rights |
| **Storage** | ~500MB temporary space |
| **Internet** | Required for database updates |

## 🚦 Quick Start

### Method 1: One-Click Execution
```batch
# Download and run as Administrator
Universal-Intel-Chipset-Updater.bat
```

### Method 2: PowerShell Direct
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator, then:
.\Universal-Intel-Chipset-Updater.ps1
```

### Method 3: Hardware ID Scanner Only
```batch
# For diagnostic purposes
Get-Intel-HWIDs.bat
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Hardware Detection
- Scans PCI devices for Intel Vendor ID (8086)
- Identifies chipset-related components
- Extracts Hardware IDs and current driver versions

### 2. Database Query
- Downloads latest INF database from GitHub
- Matches detected HWIDs with compatible packages
- Compares current vs latest versions

### 3. Security Verification
- Creates system restore point
- Downloads from primary/backup sources
- Verifies SHA-256 hashes
- Validates Intel digital signatures

### 4. Installation
- Executes official Intel setup with safe parameters
- Handles both ZIP and EXE package formats
- Provides real-time progress feedback

## 🛡 Security First Approach

### 🔒 Verified Security Layers
```text
1. File Integrity → SHA-256 Hash Verification
2. Authenticity → Intel Digital Signatures
3. System Safety → Automated Restore Points
4. Source Reliability → Dual Download Sources
5. Privilege Control → Admin Rights Enforcement
```
